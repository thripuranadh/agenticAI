# 🧩 LangGraph

LangGraph is an advanced framework for building **stateful, multi-agent applications**.

---

## 🔑 Core Components
- **Nodes** → Individual steps/functions that perform computation.  
- **Edges** → Define execution flow (how one node connects to another).  
- **State** → Shared memory structure that retains context across all nodes.  

---

## 🧠 Understanding LangGraph
- Models workflows as **graphs** → nodes = computation, edges = flow.  
- **State** maintains context → essential for complex workflows.  

---

## ⚡ Key Capabilities
- Supports **looping & branching** for dynamic decisions.  
- **State persistence** and **human-in-the-loop** for debugging.  

---

## ✅ Advantages Over Traditional Programming
- Explicit **state management** & **conditional transitions**.  
- **Modular** → components can be developed/debugged independently.  
- Enhanced **observability** for better debugging.  

---

## 📌 Applications
- Customer support agents with memory & adaptability.  
- Multi-agent systems with coordination.  
- Visualization with **Mermaid diagrams** for debugging workflow graphs.
