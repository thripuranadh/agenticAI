# AI Agents vs Agentic AI

| Aspect              | AI Agents (Narrow)                                          | Agentic AI (Multi-Agent)                                                    |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**      | Autonomous software entity for narrow, goal-directed tasks | Multi-agent systems collaborating to achieve complex goals                  |
| **Core Traits**     | Autonomy, task-specificity, reactivity                     | Task decomposition, inter-agent communication, memory & reflection, orchestration |
| **Design**          | One agent → one task                                       | Multiple agents with distinct roles, coordinated                            |
| **Reasoning**       | Linear (A → B)                                             | Iterative, advanced (ReAct, CoT, Tree of Thoughts)                         |
| **Memory**          | Minimal / stateless                                        | Persistent (episodic, semantic, vector)                                     |
| **Communication**   | Standalone, no coordination                                | Continuous sharing & coordination                                          |
| **Scalability**     | Limited by single-task scope                               | Scales to multi-stage, multi-agent workflows                               |
| **Applications**    | Chatbots, email filtering, enterprise search               | Research assistants, drones, medical decisions, adaptive workflow automation |
| **Challenges**      | Hallucinations, prompt sensitivity, poor long-horizon planning | Error cascades, coordination breakdowns, instability, explainability issues |
| **Emerging Solutions** | RAG (reduce hallucinations), tool/function calling       | RAG as shared grounding, orchestrated pipelines, advanced memory systems   |
| **Future Evolution** | More proactive, adaptive learning, complex reasoning       | Teams managing workflows, simulation/testing, ethical governance           |
| **Frameworks/Tools** | Limited single-agent frameworks                           | LangChain, LangGraph, IBM Bee, CrewAI, AutoGen                            |
| **Overall**         | Narrow, reactive helpers                                   | Collaborative, scalable, intelligent systems for complex real-world impact |
